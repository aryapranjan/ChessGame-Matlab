Check_valid_move is a function that checks if the selected chess piece is moving at the its correct position, for example- knight can only move in L shape and can jump across chess pieces, we are using rank_space and file_space logic in this that subtracts toRank and fromRank, fromFile and toFile to check if the particular piece is moving in the valid place, if the move is not valid, it displays illegal move
